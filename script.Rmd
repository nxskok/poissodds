leagues to get (comment out to omit)

`omit` is TRUE if you want to omit the possibility of a draw (eg for knockout games where the only possible draw is if it goes to penalties).

```{r}
leagues <- tribble(
  ~sheet_url, ~short, ~omit,
#  "https://www.oddschecker.com/football/english/fa-cup", "enf", TRUE,
  # "https://www.oddschecker.com/football/champions-league", "euc", TRUE,
  # "https://www.oddschecker.com/football/europa-league", "eue", FALSE,
  "https://www.oddschecker.com/football/euro-2020", "ec", FALSE
)
leagues
```

run for all leagues

`discount` is the multiplier for draw probability, eg something like 0.95 

```{r}
discount <- 0.9
leagues %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(p = list(make_prob_df(sheet_url, discount))) %>% 
  unnest(p) %>% 
  select(short, game, starts_with("prob"))
```


```{r}
poiss_probs(2,2)
```
